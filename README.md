# Vitouliss Computercraft-OS (For Tekkit 3.1.1)

Some stuff I made just because I needed a better OS then the default one and because I just want my own. 

Currently typing in "vitOS" or "vitSOFT" all the time is starting to get annoying. Will actually be turned into a OS soon.
(if laziness did not get in the way.) 

It's only used in my tekkit server which uses a older version of Computercraft. Also keep in mind that everything 
executes WAY different then a Computercraft operating system should so that's why some of the code looks like complete 
poop. I will fix this once my laziness goes away.

If you need to list all the commands just type in: "help" without the quotes.

# What are you doing with this currently?

Well, I'm trying to make it into a Operating system if school and indolence did not get in the way. Other then that I have
nothing else to do.
