# Vitouliss Computercraft-OS thingy

Some stuff I coded...Just because I needed a better OS then the default one and because I just want my own. 

Currently typing in "vitOS" or "vitSOFT" all the time is starting to get annoying. Will actually be turned into a OS soon.

It's only used in my server...Also keep in mind that near the end of the code....Is a mud hole sorry. 

If you need to list all the commands just type in: "help" without the quotes.
